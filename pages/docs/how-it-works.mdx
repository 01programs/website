# How Inngest works

Inngest allows you to serve durable workflows via HTTP in your own infrastructure, without
managing event streams, orchestration, or state. In this section, we'll detail how this is
possible, including:

- [Function configuration and deployment](#function-configuration-and-deployment)
- [The execution model, and how functions are invoked](#the-execution-model)
- [How function state is managed](#function-state)
- Function Versioning
- Limitations

We'll walk through these in order, introducing how Inngest works end-to-end.

## Function configuration and deployment

Prior to execution, functions must be configured served, and registered. Functions are
configured via your language's SDK. There are two key parts to function configurations:
the **definition** and the **triggers**.  For example:

```ts
inngest.createFunction(
  // Function definition
  {
    id: "post-registration",
    concurrency: 50,
    idempotency: "event.dat.auser_id",
  }
  // The triggers.
  { event: "api/user.created" },
  async ({ event, step }) => {
   // Your own durable workflow here.
  },
);
```

In this example, the function is defined with an ID, a concurrency limit, and an
idempotency key (for exactly-once processing over 24 hours). It also specifies its
trigger: this function runs every time the `api/user.created` event is received.

<Callout>
  Function definitions and triggers are separated for two reasons.  Firstly, a single event can trigger many functions (fan-out).  Secondly, functions can be triggered by more than one event.
</Callout>

Functions are configured then served via your own API, on your own infrastructure, via
our [serve handlers](/docs/sdk/serve).  Once served, you must deploy your functions
to Inngest.

### Function deploys

In order for Inngest to execute your functions, Inngest must know where your functions
are hosted.  This happens via deploys. There are several things to consider:

1. Functions are served on your own infrastructure, via your own deploy process
2. We support both servers and serverless functions
3. Inngest is typically unaware of when your deploys occur.

The deploy process is a simple handshake between the SDK and Inngest.  The SDK
reaches out to Inngest with a secret key (signing key), and pushes function
configuration to a registration endpoint. [For more information, read the
deploys guide](/docs/deploy).

### Function invocation

As part of the deploy process, Inngest sets up new listeners for your environment's
event stream.
