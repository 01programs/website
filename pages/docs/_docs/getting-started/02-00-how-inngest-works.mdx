To automatically run workflows in real time, the first step is to send event data to Inngest using our [event format](/docs/event-format-and-structure).  Once we receive them you can start configuring workflows.  You can do this using our dashboard, or with code.  Once you've created a workflow you're done &mdash; we'll take care of automatically running the logic every time we receive the event, and we'll also handle failures automatically for you.

There's more that you can do with Inngest.  You can run your own code whenever events are received, whether it's already on a platform like Lambda or Cloudflare, or if you have a Docker container.  Workflows can also handle complex functionality.  Let's take a look.
