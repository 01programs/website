A workflow wouldn't be much use without data!  When we run workflows, we allow you to access the
original event data, and we give you access to the data from every previously ran action.

Within a workflow, any action has the following data available to use:

- `event`:  the full event data.  You can use `event.data.name` to get the `name` field from the
  event data.
- `action.$N`: The output from the action with a client ID of `$N`
- `user`: all of the user's attributes, if the event belongs to a user


You can use this data via templating, which is simlar to string interpolation in languages you might
be used to.

## Action data

Each action you call within a workflow is assigned a "client ID".  After this action runs, the
output of the action will be available to the rest of the workflow.

There's one important note:  if you have multiple branches, actions can only see the data from all
of its "parents".  Two branches that run next to each other have no shared parents.  When the
braches split, actions in each branch can't refer to data from other branches.  Let's explain why:

Let's take the following workflow:

```
SCREENSHOT & CONFIG
```

In this workflow, there are two branches which we'll call A (the left branch) and B (the right
branch).  They run at the same time, in parallel.

This means that **actions in branch A cannot refer to data from actions in branch B**:  it can only
see data from its own branch.  This is because actions in branch B might not have finished when
you try to access the data from branch A.
