Using our [CLI](https://github.com/inngest/inngestctl) you can deploy and manage workflows
without interacting with our UI.  This is great for managing your workflows as code using CI/CD
&mdash; you can store workflow configuration directly within your version control repo.

## Installing the CLI

You can install the CLI on any platform by running the following code:

```sh
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inngest/inngestctl/main/install.sh | sh
```

As always, you might want to inspect the shell code before running it.  This line downloads the
latest binaries for your architecture [from our releases](https://github.com/inngest/inngestctl/releases)
page into your current working directory.  You'll want to move them into your `$PATH` to use them
from any location.

You can also download the binaries manually, or build from source if you have [go](https://go.dev/)
installed.

With the CLI installed, you should be able to run `inngestctl` and show the available commands:

```sh
user@machine % inngestctl
A serverless event-driven infrastructure platform

Usage:
  inngest [command]

Available Commands:
  actions     Manages actions within your account
  help        Help about any command
  login       Logs in to your Inngest account
  workflows   Manages workflows within your Inngest account
  workspaces  Manages workspacess within your Inngest account

Flags:
  -h, --help               help for inngest
  -l, --log.level string   Log level (default "debug")
      --log.type string    Log type (one of json, tty). Defaults to 'json' without a TTY

Use "inngest [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
