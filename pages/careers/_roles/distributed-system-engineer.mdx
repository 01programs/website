title: Distributed Systems Engineer
location: Remote - Americas/Europe

Distributed Systems are always fasinating and interestingly complex,
- Keeping latency low
- Making sure the system scales, handling huge spikes with ease
- While still making sure the complexity don't grow out of control
- And keeping everything working together seamlessly and reliable

etc.

And to be able build something that scales and functions well, a Distributed Systems Engineer needs to be both a generalist and a specialist.
You need to understand how the fundamental works across the board, while also be able to dive in into specifics to build out new features or diagnose issues.

You will be expected to touch pretty much everything,
- Web APIs
- Infrastructure
- Clients (SDKs, and UI) occasionally

Because in order to know that what you build actually works or make a difference, you need to be able to see the delivery through throughout the user journey.

We're looking for an engineer who likes to take on such demanding but rewarding challenges. :D

The location of this role is between Western Europe (CET) and US Pacific time (PT).

### What you'll do

- Build features, enhancements both in open sourced and close sourced code that powers our Cloud
- Write specs for system improvements to clearly document approaches, and trade-offs
- Contribute to infrastructure improvements/performance/approaches to scale our systems as usage grows
- Collaborate with team members in projects to deliver features and enhancements
- Interact with users through multiple channels (Discord, GitHub, Support)
- Build out tooling to help improve overall internal productivity
- Write blogs (e.g. technical deep dives, incident retros), and contribute to awareness and maximize the outreach of your work
- Make sure systems are secure

### What you've done in your career

- You've been working on distributed systems for several years
- You've used Go or somewhat similar statically typed languages professionally for 2 years or more
- You've architected or been involved in designing systems that can handle massive scale

**Plus points**

While the following are not requirements, they are huge plus if you have them under your belt.

- SRE experiences, managing system uptime and on-calls
- Observability experience, either building out the features or being an operator
- Work with compliance (SOC2, ISO27001, HIPAA, etc) and know how to make it serve security approaches, and not the other way around
- Good understanding of Networking

### What your first 90 days will look like

- First week: You'll learn how we work as a team and our approach to growth. You'll also start to learn our system architecture and hopefully make a couple small contributions to our codebase.
- By day 30: You'll be proficient with our weekly cadence of work and you'll have contributed a new feature or enhancement to our dev server or cloud platform. You'll fully understand our company, product, and growth strategy and start to build up context for your product mindset.
- By day 90: You'll have shipped significant changes to our open source project as well as our cloud platform that you also had a hand defining the spec for. You'll also have learned where you feel you can contribute to outside of the engineering domain (growth, UX design, DevRel, etc.) and have contributed ideas around product and growth. We're all aligned and mutually excited about how we work together now and in the future!
